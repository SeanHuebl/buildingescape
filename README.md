# Building Escape

Project: Building Escape | Language: C++ | Unreal Engine‍

For this project I had to implement a grabber function, triggered by a keyboard input, on the main character pawn. The function should be able to pick up physics objects, move them, and release them. This was so I could move objects of a certain weight into a certain area, thus unlocking the room puzzle and making escape possible.On this project I learned how to change the default player pawn to a custom pawn. Cast out in front of the pawn to determine if object is in range, and if the player can pick it up. Make a door triggered by a specific weight of physics objects to open a door. I also learned how to manipulate an object's pitch, yaw, and roll in code as well as always getting the player's world position. With this project I became a lot more comfortable with understanding namespaces in C++ and using logging to my advantage to determine if my code is working in each small part that adds to the entire project!
